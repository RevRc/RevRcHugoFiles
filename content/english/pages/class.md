### Rev RC strives to be easy to join and get going with rc racing. We welcome all age levels and experience.  
Members are allowed on the track with almost any eletric RC with appropriate Tires.  (Non-aggressive tred)

While each class differs, a general guide is 1/10 scale should run 2s batteries and 1/8 scale run 4s.

We can combine classes for club racing, for example stadium trucks could run with another class.
